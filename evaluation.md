# Evaluation

For the evaluation, we shared the tool with one of our advisors.
Unfortunately, they hadn't gotten around to the tool in time
thanks to vis paper deadlines. As a result, we decided to review
the tool ourselves. In addition, evaluation details below are 
based one prototype presentation feedback.

## Types of Feedback

In general, feedback was positive. However, there were a few things
that needed improvement in the original prototype. The following
list contains all feedback:

- Colors
    - Too closely related (light blue and dark blue)
    - Yet, calming
- Velocity plot
    - Difficult to see differences in curves
    - Plot may not be capturing appropriate data (summing velocities)
    - Look into normalization
- Target audience
    - Musicians don't care about time steps - they want beats and measures
- Interactivity
    - Playback should animate graphs

## Changes to Address Feedback

To address some of the feedback from above, we decided to look into the
following changes:

- Adding a time marker to show where we are in the song
- Changing velocity plot to show range of values for each track
- Reordering the color array so additional tracks have drastically different colors

Whether or not they all get implemented before the deadline is a separate
issue, but these look like a nice step in the right direction.
